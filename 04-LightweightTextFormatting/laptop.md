A **laptop computer** or **notebook computer**, also known as a **laptop** or **notebook**, is a small, portable [personal computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer) (PC). Laptops typically have a [clamshell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clamshell_design) [form factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_factor_(design)) with a [flat-panel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat-panel) [screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_screen) on the inside of the upper lid and an [alphanumeric keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphanumeric_keyboard) and [pointing device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_device) on the inside of the lower lid.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop#cite_note-2) Most of the computer's internal hardware is fitted inside the lower lid enclosure under the keyboard, although many modern laptops have a built-in [webcam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcam) at the top of the screen, and some even feature a [touchscreen display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen). In most cases, unlike[ tablet computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer) which run on [mobile operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system), laptops tend to run on desktop operating systems, which were originally developed for [desktop computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer).

Laptops can run on both [AC power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_supply) and [rechargable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rechargable) [battery packs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_pack) and can be folded shut for convenient storage and transportation, making them suitable for [mobile use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_computing).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop#cite_note-Wikipedia-3) Laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at work (especially on [business trips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_trip)), in [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education), for [playing games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_game), [web browsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser), for personal [multimedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia), and for general [home computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer) use.

# Types of Laptops

### Smaller and larger laptops
Main articles: [Notebook (laptop)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notebook_(laptop)), [Subnotebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnotebook), and [Desktop replacement computer(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_replacement_computer)]

There were in the past a number of marketing categories for smaller and larger laptop computers; these included "notebook" and "subnotebook" models, low cost "netbooks", and "ultra-mobile PCs" where the size class overlapped with devices like smartphone and handheld tablets, and "Desktop replacement" laptops for machines notably larger and heavier than typical to operate more powerful processors or graphics hardware. All of these terms have fallen out of favor as the size of mainstream laptops has gone down and their capabilities have gone up; except for niche models, laptop sizes tend to be distinguished by the size of the screen, and for more powerful models, by any specialized purpose the machine is intended for, such as a "gaming laptop" or a "mobile workstation" for professional use.

### Convertible, hybrid, 2-in-1


The latest trend of technological convergence in the portable computer industry spawned a broad range of devices, which combined features of several previously separate device types. The hybrids, convertibles, and 2-in-1s emerged as crossover devices, which share traits of both tablets and laptops. All such devices have a touchscreen display designed to allow users to work in a tablet mode, using either multi-touch gestures or a stylus/digital pen.

Convertibles are devices with the ability to conceal a hardware keyboard. Keyboards on such devices can be flipped, rotated, or slid behind the back of the chassis, thus transforming from a laptop into a tablet. Hybrids have a keyboard detachment mechanism, and due to this feature, all critical components are situated in the part with the display. 2-in-1s can have a hybrid or a convertible form, often dubbed 2-in-1 detachable and 2-in-1 convertibles respectively, but are distinguished by the ability to run a desktop OS, such as Windows 10. 2-in-1s are often marketed as laptop replacement tablets

2-in-1s are often very thin, around 10 millimetres (0.39 in), and light devices with a long battery life. 2-in-1s are distinguished from mainstream tablets as they feature an x86-architecture CPU (typically a low- or ultra-low-voltage model), such as the Intel Core i5, run a full-featured desktop OS like Windows 10, and have a number of typical laptop I/O ports, such as USB 3 and Mini DisplayPort.

2-in-1s are designed to be used not only as a media consumption device but also as valid desktop or laptop replacements, due to their ability to run desktop applications, such as Adobe Photoshop. It is possible to connect multiple peripheral devices, such as a mouse, keyboard, and several external displays to a modern 2-in-1.

Microsoft Surface Pro-series devices and Surface Book are examples of modern 2-in-1 detachable, whereas Lenovo Yoga-series computers are a variant of 2-in-1 convertibles. While the older Surface RT and Surface 2 have the same chassis design as the Surface Pro, their use of ARM processors and Windows RT do not classify them as 2-in-1s, but as hybrid tablets.[46] Similarly, a number of hybrid laptops run a mobile operating system, such as Android. These include Asus's Transformer Pad devices, examples of hybrids with a detachable keyboard design, which do not fall in the category of 2-in-1s.
